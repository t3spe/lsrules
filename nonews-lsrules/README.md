# nonews-lsrules
Tired of all the bad news that is literally flooding you wherever you are, if you want it or not? 

Wish there was a Little Snitch rules set that could just remove all this noise? I have been looking around for something like this and there isn't anything available so thought about building my own. The hard part is actually collecting what to block. Fortunatelly I have found a pretty good resource here: http://www.abyznewslinks.com/

This projects just takes all the links and builds a block lists out of it. That is all.
